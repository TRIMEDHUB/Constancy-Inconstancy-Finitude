# Constancy-Inconstancy-Finitude

This repository contains the implementation of the Theory of Constancy, Inconstancy, and Finitude, including computational simulations to model stellar evolution.

## ðŸ“Š Generated Graphs
The scripts in this repository generate visualizations representing:
- The evolution of stellar luminosity over time.
- The three phases of the model: **Constancy**, **Inconstancy**, and **Finitude**.
- The comparison of simulated results with observational data.

## ðŸ“œ How to Use
To run the scripts and generate the graphs:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Constancy-Inconstancy-Finitude.git
