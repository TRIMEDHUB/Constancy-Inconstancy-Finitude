# Constancy-Inconstancy-Finitude

This repository contains the implementation of the Theory of Constancy, Inconstancy, and Finitude, including computational simulations to model stellar evolution.

## Generated Graphs

The scripts in this repository generate visualizations representing:
- The evolution of stellar luminosity over time.
- The three phases of the model: **Constancy**, **Inconstancy**, and **Finitude**.
- The comparison of simulated results with observational data.

## How to Use

To run the scripts and generate the graphs:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TRIMEDHUB/Constancy-Inconstancy-Finitude.git

python oscillator.py

jupyter notebook alpha_sensitivity_test.ipynb

## Sensitivity Analysis

This repository also includes a sensitivity test for the decay rate α used in the luminosity model.

See `alpha_sensitivity_test.ipynb` to explore how small variations in α affect the luminosity decay curve in stellar simulations.
